This is a collection of all available commands. Some have some history which I try to explain.

== Admin Commands

IMPORTANT: These commands require you to be at least mod.

CAUTION: While sleeping the bot will not register any patschers.

These commands allow you to add and remove the bot from your channel.
As well as pausing and unpausing the bot.
Some of these commands require you to be in the bots channel.

=== How to pause the bot

* `~go sleep`
* `~shut up`
* or `~sei ruhig`

All of these make the bot '`sleep`' and not react to anything in the chat.

=== How to resume the bot

* `~wake up`
* or `~wach auf`

This is the only command you can use while the bot is '`asleep`'.


=== Join a Channel

IMPORTANT: You need to be in the bots channel

* `~join my channel` and the bot will join your channel

=== Leave a Channel

* In any channel where you are a moderator: `chronophylosbot leave this channel pls`

* In the bots channel:
  `~leave <your name>`
+
For example:

 chronophylos: ~leave chronophylos pls
 chronophylosbot: I left chronophylos.

=== Set the bot to lurk

WARNING: I have not added a command to reverse this image:https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/6cc98cf377eb36651f39add2ef73fbcf.png[4HEad,32,32]

If you are a mod in my channel you can send the bot to any channel to lurk with
`~lurk in <channel name>`


== User Commands

=== Get the current Version

* `~version`
* `chronophylosbot?`

=== Voicemails

What I call voicemails are simple messages you can leave for a user.
Whenever that user writes in chat again the bot will tell the user about all their messages.

You can do this with `~tell <recipent> <message>`

 chronophylos: ~tell marc_yoyo PepegSit
 chronophylosbot: I'll forward this message to marc_yoyo when they type something in chat.
 marc_yoyo: monkaS
 chronophylosbot: @marc_yoyo, one message for you: chronophylos: PepegSit

You can also send the same message to multiple recipents by appending their name with `&&`

 chronophylos: ~tell StreamElements && moobot && Nightbot bots FeelsNotsureMan
 chronophylosbot: I'll forward this message to StreamElements, moobot and Nightbot when they type something in chat.

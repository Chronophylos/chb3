This is a collection of all available commands. Some have some history which I try to explain.

== State Commands

IMPORTANT: These commands require you to be at least mod.

CAUTION: While sleeping the bot will not register any patschers.

=== How to pause the bot

* `go sleep chronophylosbot`
* `shut up chronophylosbot`
* or `sei ruhig chronophylosbot`

All of these make the bot '`sleep`' and not react to anything in the chat.

=== How to resume the bot

* `wake up chronophylosbot`
* or `wach auf chronophylosbot`

This is the only command you can use while the bot is '`asleep`'.

== Admin Commands

These commands allow you to add and remove the bot from your channel.
Some of these commands require you to be in the bots channel.

=== Join a Channel

IMPORTANT: You need to be in the bots channel

* `join my channel pls` and the bot will join your channel
* as the owner I can just write `join <channel name> pls`

=== Leave a Channel

* In any channel where you are a moderator: `chronophylosbot leave this channel pls`

* In the bots channel:
  `leave <your name> pls`
+
For example:

 chronophylos: leave chronophylos pls

=== Set the bot to lurk

WARNING: I have not added a command to reverse this image:https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/6cc98cf377eb36651f39add2ef73fbcf.png[4HEad,32,32]

If you are a mod in my channel you can send the bot to any channel to lurk with
`lurk in <channel name> pls`
